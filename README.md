# Experiments with Stable Baselines 3

The goal for this repo is for me to start understanding how to perform different types of experiments in deep reinforcement learning. The plan at the moment is to start with easy to run and easy to understand (and interpret!) experiments and move on from there.

# Weights and Biases

WanB has introduced an integration with SB3, which now makes what I am trying to do much easier. For more information please see [SB3 Integration](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/stable-baselines-3). My first plan is to re-create several of the experiments done by [Costa Huang from Drexel University](https://costa.sh/).
